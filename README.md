# RouteBuddy

## Abstract
The RouteBuddy project addresses the challenges of urban transportation by developing a web-based carpooling application. Combining dynamic coordination of ride offerings with the power of Google Maps API, the application enhances the carpooling experience for users. The project leverages technologies such as Spring Boot, MongoDB, React, and Google Maps API to provide a sustainable and user-friendly solution to urban congestion and pollution.

## 1. Introduction
Carpooling is a compelling solution to urban transportation challenges. The RouteBuddy application facilitates efficient ride-sharing by connecting users with available vehicles on similar routes. The integration of Google Maps API provides better visualization and real-time directions, making it a standout solution for urban transportation challenges.

### 1.1 Problem Definition
Urban challenges like traffic congestion, rising fuel costs, and environmental pollution necessitate an innovative carpooling solution. The project aims to overcome inefficiencies in existing carpooling systems, such as suboptimal resource utilization and lack of real-time coordination.

### 1.2 Objectives
- Develop a web-based carpooling application with automated scheduling.
- Implement a dynamic matching algorithm for efficient ride coordination.
- Enhance user experience with Google Maps API for interactive maps and real-time directions.

### 1.3 Existing System
Traditional carpooling models lack real-time coordination, leading to inefficiencies. RouteBuddy aims to address these limitations by introducing advanced functionalities and technology.

### 1.4 Proposed System
The proposed carpooling system leverages technology and the Google Maps API for better route visualization and real-time directions, providing a more dynamic and user-centric alternative.
